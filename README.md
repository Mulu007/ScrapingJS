# ðŸ“¥ Image Downloader Script

This JavaScript script automates the process of downloading a series of image files from a specified URL pattern. It is particularly useful for batch-downloading sequentially numbered resources, such as textbook diagrams or slides.

## Functionality

- Iterates over a defined numeric range (`start` to `end`)
- Dynamically constructs image URLs using padded numbers (e.g., `001`, `002`, ..., `656`)
- Fetches each image as a binary blob
- Automatically triggers a download for each image in the browser

## How It Works

1. **URL Construction**  
   Each image URL is generated by combining a base URL with a zero-padded index number and the `.jpg` extension.

2. **Fetch & Save**  
   The `fetchAndSave()` function uses the Fetch API to retrieve the image and create a temporary download link, which is programmatically clicked to initiate the download.

3. **Automation**  
   The script loops through all numbers in the specified range and downloads each corresponding image sequentially.

## Usage

To use this script:

1. Open your browser's Developer Console.
2. Paste the script into the console.
3. Press Enter to begin downlaoding the images.
